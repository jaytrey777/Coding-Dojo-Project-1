## To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
    - During the exploratory data analysis, histograms and boxplots were visualized for relevant numeric and categorical datatype columns. 
    - Also, a heat map was used to show the correlations between the data. 
    - This gave a good baseline for all of the numeric and categorical columns for univariate data.

This histogram shows that over 1400 stores were established in 1985, but there were less than 600 established in 1998. There were also no stores established between 1988 and 1997, but there were a litte over 900 stores established all of the other years.

This box plot shows that the median price of the items is a little less than $150 where the majority of the prices are between $90 and $190. The max pirce is around $260 and the minimum price is around $30.

### Expanatory Data Analysis
    - To visualize the data for explantory purposes, two bargraphs and two scatterplots were chosen.
    - The bar graphs were chosen to show how sales related to categorical data and scatterplots were chosen to show how sales relates to numerical data.
    - Finally, three of the graphs have a hue to help distinguish more informatino abour the data.

This barchart shows that the most sold item is starchy foods and the least is other types of food. It also shows that the type of food does not influence sales a lot as there is not one category that is a far and away leader.
